# Portfolio
This is the second Challenge, creating a portfolio.

A portfolio of work can showcase skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights the applicant's strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can't be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

# Description

This challenge is about making a portfolio with these features:
   A portfolio page is displayed with a photo/avatar of the developer and links to sections: about the developer, work examples, and contact information

If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.


Challenge Elements
Challenges adhere to a format that's commonly used by software development teams that use agile project management to manage their work. Practicing this will prepare you for the workflows you'll experience as a professional full-stack web developer.

DEEP DIVE
Each Challenge contains the following elements:

User Story: 

Acceptance Criteria: 

Mock-up: 

Submission: 


NOTE
This layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px. In future lessons, you will learn how to make elements "responsive" so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio
Welcome to this module's Challenge! This is an even-numbered module, so you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you'll create a web application from scratch! This module, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses.



With these points in mind, in this Challenge you'll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you'll use during your job search. It's a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!



Let's look at what a user story written from the perspective of a hiring manager might look like. As you might remember, we follow the AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format.

## User Story:
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs:
## Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
Mock-Up
The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

How to Complete the Challenge
Follow these steps to complete the challenge:

Use the Acceptance Criteria as a guide for how you'll plan deadlines, sketch, and code your portfolio.

Ensure that your work meets the Acceptance Criteria and the full list of grading requirements.

Reach out to your instructional support team throughout the module for help.

Follow submission instructions.
This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria:

## Your Task

Welcome to this week's Challenge! This is an even-numbered week, so you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you'll create a web application from scratch! This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. 

With these points in mind, in this Challenge you’ll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you will use during your job search. It’s a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!

**Note:** If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.

Let’s take a look at what a user story written from the perspective of a hiring manager might look like. As you might remember from your first Challenge, we follow the AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format.
